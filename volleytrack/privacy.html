    <h1>Privacy Policy for VolleyTrack</h1>
    <p>Last updated: February 6, 2026</p>

    <p>HarpElle Development ("we", "our", "us") operates the VolleyTrack mobile application (the "Service").</p>

    <h2>Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <p>VolleyTrack is designed with privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, or share any personal data on our servers. All match data, statistics, and team information entered into the app are stored locally on your device.</p>

    <h2>AI Features</h2>
    <p>If you choose to use the AI Narrative features, match statistics (scores, player names, and play-by-play logs) are sent to Google's Gemini API for processing. This data is used solely to generate the match recap and is not used to train Google's models. No personal identifiable information beyond the names you entered in the roster is transmitted.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app may use third-party services that collect information used to identify you, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Google Play Services</li>
        <li>Expo</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
